  Genomes computationally inferred from large metagenomic data sets
  are often incomplete and may be missing functionally important
  content and strain variation.  We introduce an information retrieval
  system for large metagenomic data sets that exploits the sparsity of
  DNA assembly graphs to efficiently extract subgraphs surrounding an
  inferred genome. We apply this system to recover missing content from
  genome bins and show that substantial genomic sequence variation is
  present in a real metagenome. Our software implementation is available
  at \url{https://github.com/spacegraphcats/spacegraphcats} under the
