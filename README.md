# 2018-paper-spacegraphcats

This is the paper repository for "Exploring neighborhoods in large
metagenome assembly graphs reveals hidden sequence diversity.",
[Brown et al., 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/05/462788).

The paper is in `paper/`; use `make` to build the `main.pdf` file.

Figure generation code is in `paper/figures/` along with supporting
pipeline output.

The base pipeline for generating the primary sequence output files is in
`pipeline-base/`. See [the README](pipeline-base/README.md) for more info.

The remaining analysis pipelines are under `pipeline-analyses/`. See
[the README](pipeline-analyses/README.md) for more info.
